          <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
          <p>My goal was to research and ideate around iOS Today View Widgets. A successful project would identify how to best approach this project from an interaction design and user experience standpoint.</p>

          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>My audience for the project was customers who have installed the client’s iOS mobile app and use it to pay bills or access any of the value-added features available within the app.</p>

          <h3>Team / Role</h3>
          <p>The team was composed of myself, my team lead, a visual designer, and the business stakeholders. I performed the majority of the analysis and ideation work with guidance from my team lead and presented our findings to business stakeholders.</p>

          <h3>Constraints</h3>
          <p>The project’s undefined problem was the biggest hurdle here. Rather than understanding whether we should implement a Today View Widget, it was decided that this was another feature we should create in the app.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>To begin the project I decided to break it into three phases: research, contextualization, and prototyping.</p>

          <hr />

          <h4>Research Phase</h4>
          <p>For research I read blog posts, articles, forums, and developer documentation related to Today View Widgets and the Notification center. I also reviewed existing Today View Widgets and while I was reading and experimenting with apps I coded for common themes. This would allow me to easily identify themes when communicating the value and best approaches to a potential Today View Widget.</p>

          <hr />

          <h4>Context Phase</h4>
          <p>When the project was initiated iOS Today View Widgets were still a very new addition to iOS. I provided an overview of the iOS 8 Notification Center to ensure all stakeholders had the same context. I also explained the different intents of Today View Widgets and Notifications; Today View Widgets are intended to empower users, whereas Notifications are to inform users.</p>
          <p>I included this analysis in the initial presentation, exerpts of which are below:</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-intro-widget-types.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-intro-widget-types.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-intro-information-types.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-intro-information-types.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Next I performed a competitive analysis of direct competitors in the marketplace to identify any existing best practices or examples of poor implementations. As Today View Widgets were very new, no competitors existed in the market, which provided us a competitive advantage if our speed-to-market and implementation were good.</p>

          <p>The third thing I included was a rundown of the intent of the main types of Today View Widgets, which are for surfacing timely or contextual information from the app, or surfacing core app functions for quick access. I provided examples of each of these types of Today View Widgets to serve as an anchor for the wireframe concepts I would show later.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-example-contextual.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-example-contextual.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-example-functionality.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-example-functionality.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-example-timely.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-example-timely.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <hr />

          <h4>Prototyping Phase</h4>
          <p>Before presenting the wireframe concepts I listed some considerations of what would provide a poor customer experience, or what technical constraints we might encounter. Next we described how the functionality could work based on our understanding of the technology capabilities, the existing app features, and the Today View Widget best practices.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-wire-contextual.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-wire-contextual.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-wire-functionality.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-wire-functionality.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-wire-timely.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-wire-timely.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <p>My team lead and I discussed these options with the stakeholders, reviewed technology constraints, and made notes of the opportunities and risks presented in these wireframes. Our next step was to regroup and provide another round of wireframe revisions, this time putting the wireframes in InVision to demonstrate the interactions that the Today View Widget would enable.</p>

          <p>After further revisions based on new technology information and stakeholder feedback, I worked with a visual designer to create detailed comps which were presented to the stakeholders.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-final-mockups.png"><img src="img/tvw/tvw-final-mockups.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>After a successful presentation to our business stakeholders, the development budget was reallocated and the project placed on hold.</p>
          
          <hr />

          <h3>Retrospective</h3>
          <p class="lead">This project was a success in the stakeholders estimation.</p>
          <p>If I could go back in time, I would prefer to understand whether this was a valid user need. I would also explore other ways of encouraging engagement with the app that might have more traction with a larger user base.</p>
