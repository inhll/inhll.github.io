          <h1>Formative Resale Research</h1>
          <p class="lead">A large insurance company deployed a new area of a mobile app and wants to see how effective the tool is so they can further improve the user experience. During the project new constraints arise and there is an unexpected pivot.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 well">
          <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
          <p>The new area of the app was created with newer, modern interaction patterns which needed validation. The project would be a success if we were able to uncover new insights into how users interact with the patterns and app.</p>
          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>As the testing was for the purpose of vetting the interaction patterns, the participant demographics were pretty general: people who had downloaded mobile apps to their phone.</p>

          <h3>Team / Role</h3>
          <p>I developed the test plan, scenarios, script, and recruited, took test notes, analyzed results, and presented findings to the business stakeholders. At all times I had my team lead and other researchers available to bounce ideas off of.</p>

          <h3>Constraints</h3>
          <p>Our timeline to present findings was only two (2) weeks away, so formal recruitment and usability testing were not feasible. Additionally, the most current build was only available on test devices, so testing was limited to the company campus.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p class="lead">To begin I gathered existing test plans, scenarios, and artifacts from the research team.</p>
          <h4>The Research Plan</h4>
          <p>Given the short project timeline we would not be able to recruit external participants and work in a formal usability lab. Our initial research plan had us using a mailing list to recruit stakeholder colleagues and a conference room as a testing environment where we would capture information via video and have a note-taker. We realized participants would have industry knowledge which could bias their results, but this was mitigated by our focus on interaction patterns and ease-of-use.</p>
          <p>With this approach in mind I wrote a rough test plan and revised it with assistance from my team lead and research colleagues.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <p class="text-center">
                <a href="img/gut-original-test-plan.png"><img src="img/gut-original-test-plan.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Next I wrote scenarios which ensured participants came into contact with all the new interaction patterns. After a round of revision with my team lead, I sent the test plan and scenarios to our stakeholders for approval.</p>

          <hr />
          <h4>The Pivot</h4>
          <p>At this point, the stakeholders approved of the plan, but had found the mailing list recruitment process would take longer than initially anticipated. Given this additional hurdle, we decided to shift our format from informal usability testing to guerrilla usability testing.</p>

          <p>My team lead and I met with the client’s UX research team to discuss strategies for performing guerrilla testing onsite at the client campus. This meeting provided us with excellent context and clarified our path forward.</p>
          <p>With these insights I revised our test plan once again and sent it to business for a second round of approval. Our new approach was to recruit participants in the campus cafeteria and lounge area, asking them to think aloud during the test. </p>
          <p>As an incentive we purchased $5 Starbucks gift cards. I modified an existing consent form and also began writing the script I would use when approaching potential participants. I decided to audio-record participants to capture think-aloud details and revised the scenarios to make room for note taking both during and immediately following the testing sessions.</p>

          <hr />
          <h4>Testing</h4>
          <p>The first day of testing, I woke up with acute anxiety. I am not the sort of person who easily approaches strangers so I did breathing exercises and practiced smiling and reading through my script.</p>
          <p>When I arrived on-site I collected the iOS device, which I would be testing first. I got my documents in order, arranged my things to make testing as smooth as possible, and began approaching potential recruits. </p>
          <p>My approach to testing (recruit, run the scenario while making notes, and then review the audio immediately afterward) worked very well. The first few approaches and usability tests were a blur, but listening to the recordings afterward I sounded pretty collected. The notes caught most issues and the audio helped me clarify anything I hadn’t noted fully.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-2">
              <p class="text-center">
                <a href="img/gut-interview-1.jpg"><img src="img/gut-interview-1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <p class="text-center">
                <a href="img/gut-interview-2.jpg"><img src="img/gut-interview-2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a>
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>On the first day I was able to recruit four participants and on the second day I recruited the final iOS participant. I had anticipated recruiting Android participants as well, but the development team was actively working on the Android build, which made the test device unstable.</p>
          <p>Since I could not complete the Android scenarios, I retreated to safety where I analyzed the results of the iOS testing.</p>
          <p>Android devices were ready for testing the following week, and after honing my approach script and gaining confidence I was feeling much better. Testing went quite smoothly and I recruited all five participants in about three hours, during which my team lead took photos.</p>
          <p>In total we tested the iOS and Android builds across four scenarios, recruiting five iOS and five Android participants who completed 14 total scenarios. </p>

          <hr />
          <h4>Analysis</h4>
          <p>At this point I headed back to the office to analyze both the Android and iOS findings. I put all the instances of issues or praise into a spreadsheet and coded them for themes. Once I had identified themes I provided each a rating based on technical difficulty / scope and user impact.</p>
          <p>From these two ratings I determined the overall priority of the enhancements in a spreadsheet for the development team, and to use in my presentation to business.</p>
          <p>In the analysis phase I identified thirteen (13) enhancements which I illustrated using device screen captures and presented to the business stakeholders.</p>

          <hr />
          <h3>Retrospective</h3>
          <p class="lead">This project came off better than I was expecting and business was very happy with the findings.</p>
          <p>I gained a lot from the experience, both personally and professionally.</p>
          <p>Professionally I learned how to hone an approach script, better manage my paperwork for testing, perform research analysis, and present findings to business stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Personally I learned techniques to manage anxiety while completing my objective, and that if you smile and do your best, life will sort itself out.</p>
