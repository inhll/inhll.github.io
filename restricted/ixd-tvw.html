          <h1>iOS Today View Widget Concept</h1>
          <p class="lead">A large insurance company would like to to provide easy access to features deep within our mobile app so that customers will see the value we provide and better engage with our brand.</p>

          <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
          <p>My goal was to research and ideate around iOS Today View Widgets. A successful project would identify how to best approach this project from an interaction design and user experience standpoint.</p>

          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>My audience for the project was customers who have installed the client’s iOS mobile app and use it to pay bills or access any of the value-added features available within the app.</p>

          <h3>Team / Role</h3>
          <p>The team was composed of myself, my team lead, a visual designer, and the business stakeholders. I performed the majority of the analysis and ideation work with guidance from my team lead. I presented our findings and recommendations to business stakeholders, developed wireframes based on their feedback, and performed two revisions. Once business was pleased and we had clarified the project expectations I worked with a visual designer to develop high-fidelity visual design comps.</p>

          <h3>Constraints</h3>
          <p>The project’s undefined problem was the biggest hurdle here. Rather than understanding whether we should implement a Today View Widget, it was decided that this was another feature we should create in the app. I don’t feel the Today View Widget would have added significant value to app users and when I voiced this concern I was told to proceed under the assumption it would provide value, which I did.</p>

        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>To begin the project I read blog posts, articles, forums, and developer documentation related to Today View Widgets and the Notification center.</p>

          <h4>60,000ft Overview</h4>
          <p>When the project was initiated iOS Today View Widgets were still a very new addition to iOS. I provided an overview of the iOS 8 Notification Center to ensure all stakeholders had the same context. I also explained the different intents of Today View Widgets and Notifications; Today View Widgets are intended to empower users, whereas Notifications are to inform users.</p>
          <p>I included this analysis in the initial presentation, exerpts of which are below:</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-intro-widget-types.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-intro-widget-types.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="tvw/tvw-intro-information-types.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-intro-information-types.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <hr />

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p>Next I performed a competitive analysis of direct competitors in the marketplace to identify any existing best practices or examples of poor implementations. As Today View Widgets were very new, no competitors existed in the market, which provided us a competitive advantage if our speed-to-market and implementation were good.</p>

          <h4>Widget Types and Examples</h4>
          <p>The third thing I included was a rundown of the intent of the main types of Today View Widgets, which are for surfacing timely or contextual information from the app, or surfacing core app functions for quick access. I provided examples of each of these types of Today View Widgets to serve as an anchor for the wireframe concepts I would show later.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-example-contextual.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-example-contextual.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-example-functionality.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-example-functionality.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-example-timely.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-example-timely.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h4>Wireframe Concepts</h4>
          <p>Before presenting the wireframe concepts I listed some considerations of what would provide a poor customer experience, or what technical constraints we might encounter, and then we described how we imagined the functionality could work based on our understanding of the technology capabilities, the existing app features, and the Today View Widget best practices.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-wire-contextual.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-wire-contextual.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-wire-functionality.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-wire-functionality.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-1">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-wire-timely.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-example-timely.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <hr />

          <h4>Revision and High Fidelity</h4>
          <p>My team lead and I discussed these options with the stakeholders, reviewed technology constraints, and made notes of the opportunities and risks presented in these wireframes. Our next step was to regroup and provide another round of wireframe revisions, this time putting the wireframes in InVision to demonstrate the interactions that the Today View Widget would enable.</p>

          <p>After further revisions based on new technology information and stakeholder feedback, I worked with a visual designer to create detailed comps which were presented to the stakeholders.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <p class="text-center"><a href="img/tvw/tvw-final-mockups.png"><img src="tvw/tvw-final-mockups.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>After a successful presentation to our business stakeholders, the development budget was reallocated and the project placed on hold.</p>
          <hr />
          <h3>Retrospective</h3>
          <p class="lead">This project was a success and I would not approach the work differently.</p>
          <p>If I could go back in time, I would prefer to understand whether this was a valid user need. It is possible that a Today View Widget would not provide a better overall experience to the user.</p>
