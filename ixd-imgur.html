          <h1>Imgur Upload Experience</h1>
          <p class="lead">As an image-sharing service, Imgur wants to make uploading and sharing images simpler for users, so that they can increase overall share of, and integration in, the social image-sharing business.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 well">
          <h3>Problem Definition</h3><p>The current image upload process lacks clear direction which confuses users. A successful upload process will take a new user and show them how to effectively upload and share images.</p>
          <h3>Audience</h3><p>The project should focus on desktop users who upload images to share with others.</p>
          <h3>Team / Role</h3><p>I was working alone on this project for both research and interaction design.</p>
          <h3>Constraints</h3>
          <p>I budgeted three days for this project and wanted to do both research and interaction design. My project plan was created in about three hours with research taking another five hours. The findings, analysis, and interaction design took about fifteen hours total.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
          <h3>Design Process</h3>
          <p>This project was broken into three phases: a task flow audit, goals analysis, and interaction redesign.</p>
          <p>Understanding goals is at the core of any interaction, so before interface design begain I did a quick exploration of the goals an Imgur user might have.</p>
          <p>I performed an informal poll of friends and colleagues who have shared images online in the last month and sorted the results into a chart comparing frequency of feature use to the number of users who reported usage. This helped me understand how to prioritize features.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <p class="text-center"><img src="img/1.0.1-table.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>After focusing on features I chose what to focus on when improving the interface, settling on two principles:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Instructional — </strong>the screen should show new users the easiest way to upload an image and help them understand what to do next.</li>
              <li><strong>Goal Oriented — </strong>The interface should prioritize a users primary focus, sharing images, and cluster related controls.</li>
            </ul>
          For each step in the upload process I performed an analysis and refined the interface to clarify what the user should do at each step.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <p><img src="img/1.0.2-flow.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
            </div>
          </div>
            <hr />
            <h4>Step 1 — Choosing the Files</h4>
            <p>When users arrive on the home screen and tap the upload button they are presented with a screen with four equally weighted options (Fig. 1.1).</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
                <p><img src="img/1.1.1-ori.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 1.1 - <em>Original State</em></p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p><img src="img/1.1.2-new.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 1.2 - <em>Updated State</em></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>The trouble weighting options equally it’s not obvious which route is best. Imgur can take advantage of this opportunity to teach new users the best way to upload images.</p>
            <p>I propose a new look (Fig. 1.2) which keeps the process and options intact, but focuses new users on Drag and Drop. The new interface is much easier to scan and understand which options are available.</p>
            <hr />
            <h4>Step 2 — Beginning the Upload</h4>
            <p>Once the user has selected files to upload, the Imgur interface still does not show clear hierarchy (Fig. 2.1). Information is competing for attention and is not clearly separated by task or order of operations. Some content is green which draws the eye, visual treatment of button areas and content areas are similar, and even reading through the non-linear content is difficult.</p>
            <p>By de-emphasizing already-used controls (Fig. 2.2), hiding a few ambiguous controls (edit image & filename), and emphasizing next steps the interface what users should do next.</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p><img src="img/1.2.1-ori.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 2.1 - <em>Original State</em></p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p><img src="img/1.2.2-new.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 2.2 - <em>Updated State</em></p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p><img src="img/1.2.3-new.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 2.3 - <em>Original State w/ Gallery</em></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>I've ordered the page to provide an overview of the entire upload process:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Header Info - </strong>What user is doing and an escape hatch to abandon the upload</li>
                <li><strong>File Attachment Methods - </strong>Instructions to attach another file</li>
                <li><strong>Informational Message - </strong>Message about file upload state</li>
                <li><strong>Picture Info and Options - </strong>Information about specific file(s)</li>
                <li><strong>Upload Options / Start Upload - </strong>Select options and begin upload</li>
              </ul>
            Options like Make Album are still available (Fig. 2.3), and remain in chronological order. “Choose images, see chosen images, do something with images, and upload images.”</p>
            <p>The focus is again on accomplishing user goals. Everything points the user toward Start Upload and everything is chunky and tappable for devices accessing via mobile web.</p>
            <hr />
            <h4>Step 3 — The Upload Begins</h4>
            <p>The current Imgur interface shows each file individually and repeats the “green bar fills to the right” process for each file. This does not show the user how many total files have uploaded or how many remain to upload.</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
                <p><img src="img/1.3.1-ori.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 3.1 - <em>Original State</em></p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p><img src="img/1.3.2-new.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 3.2 - <em>Updated State</em></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>In the proposed screen I’ve kept all the previous functionality, and ensured the user knows which files have uploaded, which failed, and about how much longer it will be until the rest of the files have uploaded. There is also a message area that can display different system messages, followed by a clearly-labelled escape hatch.</p>
            <hr />
            <h4>Step 4 — The Upload Succeeds!</h4>
            <p>Now the upload process is coming to a close. In the Imgur interface, statistics, edit, description, views, posting time, etc are sprinkled about the page. Icons for social sharing are both below the picture and on the right side of the page. Share in Imgur is also not an obvious choice.</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
                <p><img src="img/1.4.1-ori.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 4.1 - <em>Original State</em></p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <p><img src="img/1.4.2-new.png" class="img-responsive"></p><p class="text-center text-muted">Figure 4.2 - <em>Updated State</em></p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>In the proposed page, the original functionality exists but has been reorganized on the page. I’ve put the title / description above the image, clustered with editing and deletion controls so operations which affect the image are all in the same area of the page. Information about photo views, posting time, and stats are in the upper right to balance the container, again to aid findability.</p>
            <p>Sharing is only available in the right panel with Imgur’s sharing prioritized, simple social sharing highlighted, and image-size controls surfaced. The existing links are also displayed below the simple share options to ensure users who need specific links are still served.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Retrospective</h3>
            <p class="lead">I feel this project was a success, and resulted in a much better upload interaction for novice Imgur users. Upon sharing the interface with two of my original task analysis participants they understood what to do immediately.</p>
            <p>If I could budget more time for this project I would like to do a full comparative usability test phase to determine the effectiveness of the updated interface.</p>
